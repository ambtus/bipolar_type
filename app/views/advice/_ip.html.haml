%p #{(t :consuming).capitalize} more seems counterproductive to the goal of getting rid of unwanted #{t :fat}, but the more I #{t :consume}, the easier it will be to #{t :produce} more.
%p But. I don’t like #{t :creating} things and if I #{t :consume} less I can #{t :produce} less.
%p
  Yes. I can #{t :produce} a
  %em little
  less.
  But I won’t. I’ll #{t :produce} a
  %em lot
  less. And I will end up with more #{t :fat} than I had before I began to #{t :consume} less.
%p But it’s hard to #{t :consume} when manic.
%p True. But it’s a lot easier to #{t :consume} in the evening than it is to try and #{t :produce} the next morning after you #{t :consume} too little.
