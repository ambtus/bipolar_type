During
=realm.adjective
depression (or while taking sedatives such as alcohol), everyone becomes less sensitive to
=realm.appearances.colon
=realm.parts
=realm.appear
less
=realm.obvious

are much less satisfying than previously.

The most important thing to remember about 
=realm.generic
depression is that you are not
=realm.consume.ing

enough.

If you want to stop
=realm.consume.ing
you must 
=realm.turn_on
so you will feel satisfied sooner.
