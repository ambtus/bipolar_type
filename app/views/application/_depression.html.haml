  Depression
%p
  During a
  =realm.domain
  depressive episode, you become less sensitive to
  =realm.neuro.colon
  it takes more
  =realm.triggery
  =realm.triggers
  to make you feel
  =realm.overwhelmed
  and you may not even feel
  =realm.full.period
%p
  If there is anything you’ve been wanting to
  =realm.consume
  — but haven’t been able to
  =realm.tolerate
  it — now is the time to
  =realm.consume
  it!
%p
  At the same time, you feel
  =realm.empty.er
  =realm.kinetics.are_phrase.open_paren
  being converted to
  =realm.potentials.close_paren
  and you will
  =realm.purge
  much less and may not even
  =realm.putz.period
%p
  =realm.things.capitalize
  to
  =realm.produce
  are not just abundant,
  =realm.things.they
  may even be eternal; I certainly don’t need to
  =realm.produce
  =realm.it
  today.
%p
  You
  %em will
  gain
  =realm.potentials
  during a depressive episode — whether you want to or not.
