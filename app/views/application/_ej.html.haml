    even if you are not

    you will not always

  %li
    you end up storing

    than you need in order to be as

    as you'd like to be
  %li
    you are willing to
    =object.consume
    =object.energy
    but you need some encouragement: the more 
    =object.energy
    you 
    =object.consume.comma
    the easier you will find it to
    =object.output
