%p Because you always try to #{subtype.consume} less which means you end up #{subtype.produce.ing} less. Thus, mania is attenuated but the subsequent depression is aggravated and prolonged.
%p You may try to take stimulants in order to prolong the mania so you will lose more #{subtype.potential} but you will gain #{subtype.potential.them} all back and more during the subsequent depression when you inevitably become acclimated to the stimulants and the mania ends.
%p If you #{subtype.consume} more, you will be able to #{subtype.produce} more. If you #{subtype.consume_with} things that #{subtype.appear} good, you will feel as if you have #{subtype.consume.en} even more and will be able to #{subtype.produce} even more.
%p The more you #{subtype.produce_with}, the more #{subtype.potential} you will lose when you are manic and the less you will gain when you are depressed.
