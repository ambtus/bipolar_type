    You need to make sure your home is a nice place to visit when you are trapped in the desert of depression. 
  %p
    Stock your 
    =realm.home
    with
    =realm.triggers
    and
    =realm.alt_triggers
    and you will be able to
    =realm.putz
    when you're depressed, and you may even be able to
    =realm.purge.period
  %p
    If youâ€™re exhausted from
    =realm.purge.ing.comma
    then go home and go to sleep. 
    But keep some
    =realm.triggers
    in your
    =realm.home
    in case you have trouble going out again in the morning.
