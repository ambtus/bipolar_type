    Tops can

  %p
    If they are unable to even
    =realm.putz_short.comma
    let alone
    =realm.purge_short.comma
    they need a fresh infusion of
    =realm.triggers

    to keep
    =realm.purge.ing.period
    =realm.nontriggers.capitalize
    and
    =realm.alt_nontriggers
    will not help: they have plenty of
    =realm.strengths.comma
    theyâ€™re just temporarily out of
    =realm.energy.period
  %p
    Or they can just take a break until their
    =realm.potentials
    =realm.potentials.if_uncountable("converts", "convert")
    back to
    =realm.energy.period
