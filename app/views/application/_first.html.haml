%p.left==Wait as long as possible to start #{subtype.consume.ing}, and then #{subtype.consume} as much as possible. Why? Because the more you can #{subtype.consume} the better you will feel. If #{subtype.consume.ing} more doesn’t make you feel good, then #{subtype.consume_with} something else. 
%p.left==#{subtype.produce.capitalize} more. Why? Because the more you #{subtype.produce}, the #{subtype.low.er} you will feel, and the #{subtype.low.er} you feel  the better you will feel when you do #{subtype.consume}. But won't I be #{subtype.worn_out} sometimes if I #{subtype.produce} more? Yes. What of it? As long as you’re not so #{subtype.worn_out} you can’t #{subtype.produce} at all just keep #{subtype.produce.ing}. #{subtype.produce_with.capitalize} something else if you are too #{subtype.worn_out} in one area.
