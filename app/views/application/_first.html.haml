%p 
  Because you can. You may complain about how #{subtype.potential.many_phrase} you have, or how much you have to #{subtype.produce}, but the truth is, you are
  %em capable
  of #{subtype.consume_with.ing} an enormous quantity of #{subtype.energizers} without feeling #{subtype.ill}.
%p If you overdose on #{subtype.energizers}, you’ll just fall asleep until you have finished #{subtype.process.ing}.
%p 
  So why do you get stuck in consumption mode when you are no longer #{subtype.empty} and don’t want the extra #{subtype.kinetic}? Because you are
  %em #{paired.empty}
  (yes, you are #{paired.empty}, you just don’t notice because you are
  %em always
  #{paired.empty}) but not tired enough to sleep and too tired to start #{subtype.produce.ing}.
