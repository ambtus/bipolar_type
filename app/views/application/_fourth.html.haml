%p.left==Wait as long as possible to start #{subtype.produce.ing}, and then #{subtype.produce} as little as possible. Why? Because the less you #{subtype.produce}, the better you will feel. If #{subtype.produce_with.ing} less of one thing doesn’t make you feel better, then #{subtype.produce_with} less of something else. 
%p.left==#{subtype.consume.capitalize} less. Why? Because the less you #{subtype.consume}, the #{subtype.low.er} you will feel, and the #{subtype.low.er} you feel, the less you will #{subtype.produce}. 
%p.left==But won't I become too #{subtype.low} if I #{subtype.consume} less? No. Why not? Because no matter how little you #{subtype.consume}, you always have #{subtype.consume.en}, and always will #{subtype.consume}, steadily. Even when you don’t feel #{subtype.low}. Besides, if you are deliberately #{subtype.consume.ing} less, you could always #{subtype.consume} more if you did become too #{subtype.low}.
