%p.left==Wait as long as possible to start #{subtype.produce.ing}, and stop #{subtype.produce.ing} as soon as possible. Even if you don't feel #{subtype.worn_out}. Why? Because the more you #{subtype.produce} now, the less you will be able to #{subtype.produce} later before you do feel #{subtype.worn_out}.
%p.left==Let yourself #{subtype.consume} less. Why? Because the less you #{subtype.consume}, the less you will #{subtype.produce}. But won't I become too #{subtype.low} if I #{subtype.consume} less? No. Why not? Because no matter how little you #{subtype.consume}, you always have #{subtype.consume.en}, and always will #{subtype.consume}, steadily. Even when you donâ€™t feel #{subtype.low}.
