  You hate to
  =energy.consume.period
%p
  All of your experiences with
  =energy.consume.ing
  are negative:
  you start
  =energy.consume.ing
  because you feel
  =energy.empty
  and you stop
  =energy.consume.ing
  because the
  =energy.resources.are_phrase
  =energy.bad.period
%p
  Unfortunately, this means you usually
  =energy.consume
  “too little” and have far
  =energy.essentials.fewer_phrase
  than you need unless you
  =energy.produce
  much less than average.
