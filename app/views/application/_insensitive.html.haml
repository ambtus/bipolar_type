  Too
  =tendency.external.much.dont
  make you anxious; you rarely want to stop
  =tendency.consume1.ing
  before the
  =tendency.external.are
  all
  =tendency.gone
%p
  You
  %em want
  to
  =tendency.natural_level == "full" ? tendency.energetic_action : tendency.consume1
  more.
%p
  Unfortunately, when you keep
  =tendency.natural_level == "full" ? tendency.energetic_action.ing : tendency.consume1.ing
  you become
  =tendency.insensitive_pairs.map(&:tertiary_nature).to_sentence(:last_word_connector => ", or ").period
%p
  You donâ€™t keep 
  =tendency.natural_level == "full" ? tendency.energetic_action.ing : tendency.consume1.ing
  because itâ€™s better to be
  =tendency.nature
  than to be
  =render "pairs", :pairs => tendency.insensitive_pairs
