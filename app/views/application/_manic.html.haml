-case subtype.attitude.adjective
-when "productive"
  Make every attempt to #{subtype.achieve_goals}. Doing so will give you pleasure. #{subtype.high_energy_activities.capitalize} if you can; #{subtype.low_energy_activities} if you are feeling tired or #{subtype.tired}.
-when "appreciative"
  Try to #{subtype.high_energy_activities} more, or at least #{subtype.low_energy_activities}. Not because #{subtype.achieve_goals.ing} gives you pleasure, but because the more #{subtype.energy} you use now, the more #{subtype.resources} you will be able to #{subtype.harvest} when you are depressed which does give you pleasure.
-when "manic"
  Make every attempt to
  %em not
  #{subtype.high_energy_activities}. The more #{subtype.energy} you use now, the more #{subtype.high_energy_resources} you will have to #{subtype.get_more_energy} when you are depressed. If you want to #{subtype.achieve_something}, then #{subtype.low_energy_activities}. The pleasure of #{subtype.achieve_goals.ing} will not then be tarnished by the anticipation of the pain to follow.
-when "depressed"
  When you need to #{subtype.achieve_something}, #{subtype.low_energy_activities.ing} will always give you more pleasure than #{subtype.high_energy_activities.ing}. Whether or not you should #{subtype.high_energy_activities} when you
  %em donâ€™t
  have any#{subtype.thing} you need to #{subtype.achieve} depends on how #{subtype.stored_energy.much} #{subtype.stored_energy} you have in your #{subtype.storage} and whether getting rid of the surplus is worth the pain of feeling #{subtype.tired} while #{subtype.high_energy_activities.ing}.
