%p.left==Wait as long as possible to start #{subtype.produce.ing}, and then #{subtype.produce} as much as possible. Why? Because the more you #{subtype.produce}, the better you will feel and the less often you #{subtype.produce} the more you will allow yourself to #{subtype.produce} when you do. If #{subtype.produce_with.ing} more of one thing doesnâ€™t make you feel better, then #{subtype.produce_with} something else. 
%p.left==#{subtype.consume.capitalize} more. Why? Because the more you #{subtype.consume}, the #{subtype.high.er} you will feel, and the #{subtype.high.er} you feel, the more you will be able to #{subtype.produce}. 
%p.left==But I feel #{subtype.ill} when I #{subtype.consume} more. If #{subtype.consume_with.ing} one thing makes you feel too #{subtype.ill}, then #{subtype.consume_with} something else. Just as long as you keep #{subtype.consume.ing}.
