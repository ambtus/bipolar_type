    If they become overloaded with unwanted

    they need to
    =realm.putz_verb
    =realm.big.er
    =realm.putz_nouns
    and
    =realm.consume
    =realm.triggers
    and

    only when they feel
    =realm.empty.period
  %p
    =Attitude.second.domain.pluralize.capitalize
    needs to purge their
    =realm.environment
    of
    =realm.triggers
    and
    =realm.alt_triggers
    and go out for fresh
    =realm.resources
    after they feel
    =realm.empty
    because they cannot stop
    =realm.putz_short.ing
    and actually
    =realm.purge_short
    (like a Top does) or
    =realm.consume
    =realm.nontriggers
    and
    =realm.alt_nontriggers
    when
    =realm.triggers
    and
    =realm.alt_triggers
    are readily available
    (like a Bottom can).
