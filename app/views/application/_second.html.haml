%p.left==Wait as long as possible to start #{subtype.produce.ing}, and then #{subtype.produce} as much as possible. Why? Because the more you can #{subtype.produce} the better you will feel. If #{subtype.produce.ing} more doesn’t make you feel good, then #{subtype.produce_with} something else. 
%p.left==#{subtype.consume.capitalize} more. Why? Because the more you #{subtype.consume}, the #{subtype.high.er} you will feel, and the #{subtype.high.er} you feel  the better you will feel when you do #{subtype.produce}. But won't I be #{subtype.ill} sometimes if I #{subtype.consume} more? Yes. What of it? As long as you’re not so #{subtype.ill} you become #{subtype.very_ill} just keep #{subtype.consume.ing}. #{subtype.consume_with.capitalize} something else if #{subtype.consume_with.ing} one thing makes you feel too #{subtype.ill}.
