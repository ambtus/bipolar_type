%p.left==Wait as long as possible to start #{subtype.consume.ing}, and stop #{subtype.consume.ing} as soon as possible. Especially if you feel #{subtype.ill}. Why? Because if you continue to #{subtype.consume} after you feel #{subtype.ill} you may become #{subtype.very_ill}.
%p.left==Let yourself #{subtype.produce} less. Why? Because the less you #{subtype.produce}, the less you will have to #{subtype.consume}. But won't I become too #{subtype.high} if I #{subtype.produce} less? No. Why not? Because no matter how little you #{subtype.produce}, you always have #{subtype.produce.en}, and always will #{subtype.produce}, steadily. Even when you donâ€™t feel #{subtype.high}.
