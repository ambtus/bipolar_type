%p
  Being weak (sensitive and submissive)
  is a balanced state. If you don’t have enough
  =subtype.potential.comma
  you can easily
  =subtype.produce
  less.
%p
  It doesn’t mean you have to
  let others do all your
  =subtype.produce.ing
  for you:
  you have the right to
  =subtype.produce
  even if other people want
  to
  =subtype.produce
  for you.
%p
  But if you don’t want to
  =subtype.produce.comma
  don’t
  =subtype.produce.colon
  you have the right to remain
  =subtype.unproductive.period
%ul.left
  %li
    if you are
    =subtype.worn_out.comma
    =subtype.consume
    =subtype.consume_helper
    more
    =subtype.strengtheners
  %li
    if you feel
    =subtype.empty.comma
    =subtype.consume
    =subtype.consume_helper
    more
    =subtype.buffers
  %li
    avoid unwanted
    =subtype.energizers
