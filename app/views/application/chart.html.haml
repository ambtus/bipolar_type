  and then adds an Auxiliary function-attitude constrained by the MBTI theory to one of two function-attitudes depending on your first choice. Thus the MBTI has sixteen types (eight times two).
%p
  The BipolarType theory defines your personality type based on which of four behaviors you prefer most at
  %em four different times.
  BipolarType does not constrain the function of adjacent attitudes except in that they must be unique. Thus BipolarType has twenty-four types (four factorial).
%p
  Although sixteen doesnâ€™t map onto twenty-four, you can still use your MBTI type to get you part-way to your BipolarType (as long as it is an actual
