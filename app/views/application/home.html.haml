%p BipolarType uses the MBTI&reg; letters but the concepts are not identical. Thus, the letters do not correspond to the words I use to describe the concepts.
%p You can replace the words I have used with one of the listed alternatives, or enter your own.

  If you want to change the words for more than one symbol at a time, or bookmark your changes between web sessions, please use the
