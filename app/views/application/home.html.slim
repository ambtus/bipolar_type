  =link_to 'bipolar', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder', class: 'external'
  |<> at around the same time as I first learned about
  =link_to 'personality type', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_type', class: 'external'
  | . I got my bipolar genes from my mother, but my symptoms were so different from hers or her father’s that it was years before I was diagnosed and the treatments that worked for them did not work for me.

      | being

      =link_to 'zeitgebers', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeber', class: 'external'
      |<> causes you to experience a more pronounced
      =link_to 'cycle', bipolar_path
    li
      | having a

      |> means that your
      =link_to 'symptoms', symptoms_path
      |< are unique <a href="#unique">[1]</a>
    li
      |> knowing your
      =link_to 'type', types_path
      |< allows you to choose better behaviors wherever you are in the cycle, instead of having to use sedatives and stimulants to <em>change</em> where you are in the cycle

p

  =link_to 'falsifiable', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability', class: 'external'

  |<> but it has not been validated by the psychiatric, psychological, or type communities. I am sharing it on the web because it helps

  li id='unique' Technically, your symptoms are not unique. But with 48 different BipolarTypes, each of which has four possible presenting moods, the probability that you will have the same symptoms as someone else is less than one percent.
