  I developed BipolarType for
  =link_to "my own", type_path(Type.my_path)
  use.
%p
  The
  =link_to "theory", theory_path
  is scientific (it is
  =link_to("falsifiable", "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability", :class => "external") + ")"
  but it has not been validated by the medical, psychiatric, psychological, or type communities.
%p
  I am sharing it on the web because I believe that others may find it useful or interesting.
