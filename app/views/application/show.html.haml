%h2 The Two Seasons
%p The BipolarType theory asserts that there are two different seasons of life that cycle back and forth indefinitely: summer and winter. On the equator, the two seasons are wet and dry but the concepts are similar.

%p In ancient times, there wasnâ€™t any choice. During the summer, one consumed abundant summer resources and stored up excess energy. During the winter, one conserved scarce winter resources and used up stored energy.
%p Today, you can get summer resources in the dead of winter, and winter resources in the height of summer. You can end up living in perpetual summer or perpetual winter.

%h2 The Four Realms
%p BipolarType defines four realms. Each realm has its own resources which can be consumed to get the energy necessary to produce activities in that realm.
