%p I am bipolar. I’m a rapid cycler with mixed states.
%p In 1980, I was diagnosed as “homesick” by the college psychologist despite a letter from my mother describing my familial history of bipolar disorder: my mother, her father, and his mother were all bipolar.
%p By 1984 I was morbidly obese and had been diagnosed with Major Depression. I was almost immediately “upgraded” to Bipolar II after my initial reaction to antidepressants. In 1985 I had gastric surgery; although I initially lost a lot of weight, I eventually gained it all back and more. In 1988 I had a benzodiazepine withdrawal seizure. In 1990 I was hospitalized under suicide watch after overdosing on a different benzodiazepine. A psychopharmacologist “upgraded” my diagnosis to Bipolar I with mixed states in 1991 and added rapid cycling in 1993. More recent diagnoses have been Bipolar NOS (not otherwise specified).

  In 2007 I went off all my prescription medications for a

  and never went back on after it became obvious that I was no worse. Not better, but no worse. In 2011 I started losing weight and am no longer morbidly obese. In 2017 I retired and am now financially independent. I am still occasionally suicidal, but I no longer expect to die from suicide.
%p BipolarType is advice for when medications don’t work, aren’t available, or have unacceptable side effects. BipolarType is in no way a recommendation for you to go off your medications. Both my mother and grandfather responded well to mood stabilizers and if psychopharmaceuticals had helped me I would still be taking them.
