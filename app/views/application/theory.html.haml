%h2 The 576 BipolarTypes
%p A BipolarType is the four realms distributed over the four phases of the natural cycle. For each phase you have a different realm which is most problematic.

-chunks = Phase.each.collect {|p| "#{link_to p.episode, answer_path(p.symbol)}<p class='left'>#{render 'problem', behavior: p}</p>".html_safe}

  Why 576? A dominant realm (4) with its preferred phase (4), an auxiliary realm from the ones remaining (3) with its preferred phase from the ones remaining (3), a tertiary realm from the ones remaining (2) with its preferred phase from the ones remaining (2), leaving an inferior realm (1) with its phase (1) remaing => 4x4x3x3x2x2x1x1 = 576.
  =link_to "Compare that with the MBTI", chart_path
  which is much more restrictive. It has the same number of concepts but only sixteen types. Probalby because keeping track of 576 different types wasnâ€™t really possible when the MBIT was developed, so they simplified.
