%p There are four realms, each associated with a different kind of energy.
%p Everyone has to both get and use energy, but not everyone does it at the same time. This is because many behaviors are transactional: I get energy by taking it from someone, and then use energy by giving it to someone else. This means we canâ€™t all be getting and using energy at the same time.

-Realm.all.each_with_index do |realm, external|
  %h2{id: realm.adjective}
    -Realm.all.each_with_index do |realm, internal|
      -if realm.index == external
        =realm.name
      -else
        =link_to realm.name, anchor: realm.adjective

    (#{realm.get} & #{realm.use})
  %p You #{realm.get} until you feel #{realm.adverb} restless, and then #{realm.use} until you feel #{realm.adverb} tired, and then #{realm.get} again, #{realm.use} again, and #{realm.get} again in a never-ending cycle of #{realm.adjective} intake and output.
  %p Some people #{realm.get} and then #{realm.use}, whereas others #{realm.use} and then #{realm.get}. This allows some people to #{realm.get} while others are #{realm.use.ing}. Your type is nurtured into you as a child and is the opposite of your primary #{realm.adjective} caretaker (but the same as their primary caretaker).
