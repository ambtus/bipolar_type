p Switching between #{Mood.e.description} in one realm and #{Mood.i.description} in another realm is unhealthy for both realms: #{Mood.e.balance} must be balanced with #{Mood.i.balance} intra-realm.

p But switching between #{Mood.p.description} in one realm and #{Mood.j.description} in another realm can be healthy for both realms: #{Mood.p.balance} doesn’t have to be balanced with #{Mood.j.balance} intra-realm. 

p In fact, #{Mood.p.balance} doesn’t even have to be equally balanced with #{Mood.j.balance} <em>inter</em>-realm. You will cycle between both, but you won&rsquo;t necessarily spend the same amount of time in each. And that ratio will shift over time.
