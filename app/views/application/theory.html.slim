p Trying to do less of one thing and more of something else is useless unless you are <em>willing and able</em> to do the alternative.

p Which is why we treat mania with sedatives: so we will be willing and able to stop fighting and fleeing and start resting and refueling. Similarly, we treat depression with stimulants so we will be willing and able to stop resting and refueling and start fighting and fleeing.

p Even people who are not bipolar use sedatives (such as alcohol) and stimulants (such as caffeine) to make it easier to modify their own behaviors.

p The BipolarType theory asserts that you don’t have to do the opposite of what you are doing. Instead of trying to flip where you are in the cycle with drugs, slide around the cycle: no matter where you are in the cycle there are always one or more similar behaviors that you are both willing and able to do. Without drugs. Behaviors that both make you feel better and are better for you than the behaviors you are trying to do less of.

p But different people have different personality types, and thus the behaviors that they are trying to do less of or more of differ. What works for one person just makes someone else worse.
