p A BipolarType is the four seasons (#{Mood.names.and}) distributed over the four realms (#{Realm.names.and}).

p Each BipolarType has four different subtypes, one season per realm. Each subtype is defined by its imbalance: more energy than strength, more output than intake, more strength than energy, and more intake than output.

p Winter and summer imbalances are associated with depression and mania respectively. Intake must be balanced with output so winter depression and summer mania can lead to fatal imbalances. You cannot use much more energy than you get.

p Spring and summer imbalances are just personality types, as energy does not necessarily have to be balanced with strength. You can use much more strength than energy.

p BipolarType asserts that you can best balance winter and summer by extending spring and autumn: six months of summer mania kills you quickly and six months of winter depression kills you slowly, but six months of spring energy followed by six months of autumn strength doesn&rsquo;t kill you at all.
