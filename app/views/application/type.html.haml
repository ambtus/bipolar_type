  %p using credit isn't tiring and don't have to be revved to pay cash.
  %p can only collect returns when calm and earning cash is revving.
  %h2 #{display(@type.subtypes.second.attitude)} and #{display(@type.subtypes.third.attitude)}
  %p #{display(@type.subtypes.first.realm)} and #{display(@type.subtypes.last.realm)} are always going to be unbalanced

  %h2 #{display(@type.subtypes.fourth.attitude)}
  %p can listen to music and watch results even when manic. don't have to spend just because cannot *earn*. a) using credit won't tire you and b) you're not revved up from earning cash and don't need to spend it
