You can take stimulants when surrounded by #{@type.solutions.last.thing.static} to make them less boring <em>or</em> sedatives when surrounded by #{@type.solutions.first.thing.static} to make them less stressful. But which are you supposed to take when surrounded by both #{@type.solutions.first.thing.static} <am>and</em> #{@type.solutions.last.thing.static}? How can you balance being #{formatted @type.solutions.first.imbalance} with being #{formatted @type.solutions.last.imbalance}?

%p If you want to do less of something, you should try to replace it with something you want to do more of.
%p
  If you want to do more of something, you need to do it at the right
  %em time.


%h2 Morning & Afternoon; Spring & Autumn
%p Stressed enough to change things that should be changed. Not bored enough to accept things that should not be accepted.

%p This is the easiest time to #{formatted(@type.ej)} and to <em>not</em> #{formatted @type.ep.behavior}.

%p It is, however, the hardest time to #{formatted @type.ip} or <em>not</em> #{formatted @type.ij.behavior}.

%h2 Midday & Evening

%p Bored enough to accept things that should be accepted. Not stressed enough to change things that should not be changed.

%p This is the easiest time to #{formatted(@type.ip.behavior)} and  #{formatted @type.ij.behavior.opposite}.

%p Donâ€™t bother trying to #{formatted @type.ej.behavior} or #{formatted @type.ep.behavior.opposite}. You would need stimulants, which will make you even more #{formatted @type.solutions.first.imbalance}.

%p
  This is also the easiest time to
  %em not
  #{formatted @type.ij.behavior}
  without the sedatives which would make you even more #{formatted @type.solutions.last.imbalance}.
