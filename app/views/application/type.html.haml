%p If you are compulsively #{@type.submissive.accept_things.ing} you know you <em>shouldn’t</em> be #{@type.submissive.accept.ing}, then you need to <em>stop</em> trying to #{@type.receptive.accept_things} and go #{@type.productive.change} some #{@type.productive.things} for a while. Accepting the things you can accept (#{@type.submissive.things}) doesn’t actually make accepting the things you can’t currently accept (#{@type.receptive.things}) any easier. It does, however, indicate that you are <em>not</em> actually in a receptive mood which implies that you will probably be productive if you work on your #{@type.productive.things}.

Changing the things you can change (#{@type.dominant.things}) doesn’t actually make changing the things you can’t currently change (#{@type.productive.things}) any easier. It does, however, indicate that you are <em>not</em> actually in a productive mood which implies that you will probably be appreciative of their #{@type.receptive.things}.
