%p Note: these are <em>natural tendencies</em>. Most people work fairly hard in their dominant functions to <em>overcome</em> those tendencies. Thus, someone with ESP as their <em>dominant</em> will rarely be #{word 'ESP'}. But someone with ESP as their <em>inferior</em> usually will be.
%p Note also: BipolarType doesnâ€™t actually differentiate between dominant and inferior functions. Two people with the same BipolarType may appear <em>very</em> different from each other, and have completely different MBTI&reg; Best-fit Types, even though they share the same four natural tendencies.
