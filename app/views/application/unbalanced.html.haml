%p As a child, you have to #{Function.s.send(Bipolar.e.verb)} when other people want you to #{Function.s.send(Bipolar.e.verb)}, whether or not you feel #{Bipolar.e.name}, and #{Function.s.send(Bipolar.i.verb)} when other people want you to #{Function.s.send(Bipolar.i.verb)}, whether or not you feel #{Bipolar.i.name}.

  As an adolescent your options start to open up. You can start ignoring what other people want you to do and do what you want to do when you want to do it based on your own natural rhythms.
