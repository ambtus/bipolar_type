-Realm.all.each do |realm|
  %h3=realm.kind.capitalize
  %ul
    %li

      =realm.full.colon
      =link_to realm.e.obfuscated, discover_path(@answer.next("i#{realm.path}"))
    %li
      I don’t know why I keep losing so
      =realm.energy.much("needed")
      or why I am always so
      =realm.empty.colon
      =link_to realm.i.obfuscated, discover_path(@answer.next("e#{realm.path}"))
