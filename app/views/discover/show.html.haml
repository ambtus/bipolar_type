  Note: a tendency is not the same thing as an actuality. If you work very hard 
  %em not
  to have more or less of something, then you can be pretty sure that your
  %em tendency
  is the opposite.
  This also means itâ€™s usually impossible to answer for someone else because you cannot know whether or not they are 
  %em trying 
  to be the way they are.
