%p #{(t :adjective).capitalize} mania is caused by replacing boring familiar preserved  #{t :resources} with tempting fresh new #{t :resources}. Because the #{t :resources} are tempting, you #{t :consume} more. Because you #{t :consume} more, you feel #{t :adverb} energetic and #{t :produce_wo} more.
%p It’s okay to go home and find familiar preserved #{t :resources} when you feel #{t :adverb} energetic. It’s even okay, in an emergency when fresh new #{t :resources} are unavoidable, to use small amounts of sedatives such as alcohol.
%p It’s not okay to force yourself not to #{t :consume} tempting #{t :resources}. Doing so will eventually cause unhealthy #{t :adjective} anorexia because you will no longer be able to gain wanted #{t :reserves} by switching to tempting new #{t :resources}; you will just reject them also.
