Mania (or taking stimulants)
is a problem for me because my
=realm.organ.are_phrase
very sensitive so I either have to force myself to try to
=realm.produce
less than I want to
=realm.produce
or keep 
=realm.consume.ing
until I am about to
=realm.be_sick.period
%br

Either will work. Doing both will work better. Doing neither is not really an option unless I want to lose more and more
=realm.potential
with every manic episode or whenever I take stimulants until I run out completely and die a
=realm.adjective
death.

The main advantage to
=realm.produce.ing
less than I want to
=realm.produce
is that my
=realm.strengths
will atrophy and wonâ€™t need as
=realm.energy.many_phrase
so I can
=realm.consume
less. The main disadvantage is having my
=realm.strengths
decay and being unable to 
=realm.produce
when I need to.

The main advantage to
=realm.consume.ing
more than I want to
=realm.consume
is that I can make myself want to
=realm.consume
more by choosing
=realm.resources
that objectively
=realm.appear
=realm.subtle.er
and by
=realm.consume.ing
=realm.resources.them
early in the day when I am less sensitive.
The main disadvantage is having to change what and when I
=realm.consume
as well as running the risk of miscalculating and actually
=realm.be_sick.ing
and wasting the
=realm.energy.period
