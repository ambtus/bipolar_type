      the times when you were
      encouraged to

      before you were
      =realm.high_on_energy
      were not unusual, merely more than you were used to

      the times when you were prevented from

      by

        someone who wanted you to be

      were often in direct conflict with your role in life, which is to start
      =realm.fill_up.ing
      whenever
      %em anyone
      wants to
      =realm.provide
      you

    around you wants you to become
    =realm.empty.er
    and is willing for you to
    =realm.fill_up
    less to achieve that goal, you will eventually learn that you
    “should”
    =realm.go
    more
    in order to be
    =realm.empty.er
