If you feel #{realm.overwhelmed} then you will eventually #{realm.whelm} so stop #{realm.consume.ing} immediately! When you are no longer feeling #{realm.overwhelmed} then start #{realm.consume_verb.ing} #{realm.strengtheners}. Avoid #{realm.objects} that are #{realm.obvious} or #{realm.impactful} until you are no longer manic but continue to #{realm.consume_verb} #{realm.strengtheners}. You may need sedatives if you cannot avoid the #{realm.triggers}.
