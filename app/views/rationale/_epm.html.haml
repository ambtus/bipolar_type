You may feel #{realm.overwhelmed} but you are not going to #{realm.whelm} so go ahead and #{realm.consume}. Regardless of how #{realm.potential.many_phrase} you have, your brain recognizes only that you have burned through all your available #{realm.kinetic} and are using your #{realm.potential} and that is unsustainable in the long run. It wonâ€™t let you sleep until you have #{realm.consume.en}. So save your #{realm.triggers} until the evening and #{realm.consume_verb} them then.
