If you don’t want to #{realm.consume_verb} the #{realm.triggers} then don’t. Nobody needs to #{realm.consume_verb} #{realm.impactful} #{realm.objects} as long as they #{realm.consume_verb} enough #{realm.strengtheners}. If they think the #{realm.triggers} should be #{realm.consume_verb.en} then they can #{realm.consume_verb} #{realm.objects.them}. When you think the #{realm.objects.are_phrase} important enough to be #{realm.consume_verb.en} you will #{realm.consume_verb} #{realm.objects.them}.
