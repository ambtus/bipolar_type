You feel #{realm.worn} because you try to #{realm.produce_verb} too #{realm.nouns.many_phrase}. You cannot #{realm.produce_verb} all the #{realm.nouns} in the world. At some point you need to stop and rest. The #{realm.nouns.have_phrase} remained un#{realm.produce_verb.en} this long and the world hasn't ended yet. #{realm.nouns.they.capitalize} can wait until tomorrow. And if the #{realm.nouns.are_phrase} no longer there to be #{realm.produce_verb.ed} in the morning? Then find #{realm.thing.some} else to #{realm.produce_verb}.
