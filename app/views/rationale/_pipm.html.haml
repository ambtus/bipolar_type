You feel #{realm.worn} because you are trying to #{realm.produce_verb} more #{realm.nouns}. Feeling #{realm.worn} isnâ€™t going to kill you. It just means you are getting #{realm.adverb} stronger. Assuming you keep #{realm.consume_verb.ing} #{realm.strengtheners}. So keep #{realm.produce.ing}; you need the practice. Just accept that you will often be #{realm.worn} and remember to #{realm.consume_verb} plenty of #{realm.strengtheners}.
