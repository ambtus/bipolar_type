It is triggered by ephemeral, tempting, fresh, new #{t :resources} which need to be #{t :consumed} as soon as possible or they will disappear. Increased #{t :consumption} leads to more #{t :adjective} activities (#{t :productions}) and reserves (#{t :reserves}).

Decreased #{t :consumption} leads to fewer #{t :adjective} activities (#{t :productions}) and reserves (#{t :reserves}).
