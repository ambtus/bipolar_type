      relative to your other sensitive realm, there were more times when you were
      encouraged to
      =realm.go
      when you did not feel
      =realm.high_on_energy
      than there were times when you were
      =realm.provide.en
      =realm.resources
      when you did not feel
      =realm.low_on_energy

  %li
    your “role” in life is to
    =realm.gsub(Attitude.ij.role)
