%p.center There are four realms of behavior, each centered around a different type of energy.

%h3 The Facts
%p.center increased consumption => increased production & increased energy reserves
%p.center decreased consumption => decreased production & decreased energy reserves
%h3 The Depressed Cycle
%p
  I consume more in order to produce more. The increased energy reserves are an unintended consequence:
  =succeed "." do
    =link_to Attitude.ep.name, attitude_path("ep")
%p
  I consume less in order to get rid of unwanted reserves. The decreased production is an unintended consequence:
  =succeed "." do
    =link_to Attitude.ej.name, attitude_path("ej")
%h3 The Manic Cycle
%p
  I consume less in order to produce less. The decreased energy reserves are an unintended consequence:
  =succeed "." do
    =link_to Attitude.ip.name, attitude_path("ip")
%p
  I consume more in order to gain reserves. The increased production is an unintended consequence:
  =succeed "." do
    =link_to Attitude.ij.name, attitude_path("ij")
%h2=link_to "The Sixteen Subtypes", subtypes_path
%p.center A subtype is an attitude towards a realm.

%h2 The 256 BipolarTypes
%p.center A BipolarType is a set of subtypes: one attitude for each realm.
%p.center
  It is my hope that BipolarType will make it easier for you to achieve and maintain
