  Their 
  =t :neurotransmitter 
  levels are so low that they never 
  =t :run_out  
  — and are often
  =t :overfull
  — because they always 
  =t :consume 
  =t :externals
  and you just can't 
  =t :run_out 
  when you are
  =t :consuming
  that many
  =t(:externals).punctuate
%p
  They are almost always 
  =t :producing
  because they 
  =t :consume 
  so many 
  =t :externals
  and you can't avoid feeling the need to
  =t :produce
  when you 
  =t :consume 
  that many 
  =t(:externals).punctuate
%p
  They rarely want to 
  =t :produce
  because their 
  =t :neurotransmitter 
  levels are so low but they will always 
  =t :produce 
  when they have to; they are not incapable, merely disinterested.  The more they restrain themselves from
  =t :consuming
  =t :externals
  because they are
  =t(:overfull).punctuate(",")
  the less they will want to
  =t :produce
  — but they can always 
  =t :produce
  even without
  =t :consuming
  new
  =t :externals
  because they can tap into their store of
  =t(:internals).punctuate
