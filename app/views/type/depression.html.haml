%p
  Depression, whether triggered by organic causes, sedatives, or an illness, makes the object appear less important so they produce less. At the same time the external resources appear more appealing so they consume more. If depression lasts too long their internal resources are in danger of overflowing — and triggering mania.

      They are always

      “enough” to
      =t :consume
      =t :appealing
      =t(:external_resources)
      but they will soon have more
      =t :internal_resources
      than they want or need
      when they don't feel
      =t(:competent)
      and they think the
      =t(:object).pluralize
      are too
      =t(:unimportant)
      and they stop
      =t(:producing)
      them.
      When they misidentify the problem as
      =t(:consuming).split.first
      too much and try to restrict their access to
      =t(:appealing)
      =t(:external_resources)
      they will just binge on other

      =t(:external_resources).punctuate
      The real problem is that they have stopped

      They are never

      “enough”
      to
      =t :consume
      =t :unappealing
      =t(:external_resources)
      so the depression has to last a very long time before they have more
