  If you are willing to have too
  =@quad.subtypes.first.potential.few_phrase
  and too
  =@quad.subtypes.second.potential.few_phrase
  then you can take stimulants all the time and not worry about having too
  =@quad.subtypes.third.potential.many_phrase
  or too
  =@quad.subtypes.fourth.potential.many_phrase.period
%p
  Conversely, if you are willing to have too
  =@quad.subtypes.third.potential.many_phrase
  and too
  =@quad.subtypes.fourth.potential.many_phrase
  then you can take sedatives all the time and not worry about having too
  =@quad.subtypes.first.potential.few_phrase
  or too
  =@quad.subtypes.second.potential.few_phrase.period
%p
  If, however, you want to have enough
  =@quad.subtypes.first.potential
  but not too
  =@quad.subtypes.third.potential.many_phrase
  (for example), then you have a problem.
%p
  You would like to take targeted sedative that will allow you to
  =@quad.subtypes.first.consume
  more
  =@quad.subtypes.first.energy
  and 
  =@quad.subtypes.second.use
  =@quad.subtypes.second.energy.fewer_phrase
  and stimulants that will allow you to
  =@quad.subtypes.third.use
  more
  =@quad.subtypes.third.energy
  and
  =@quad.subtypes.fourth.consume
  =@quad.subtypes.fourth.energy.fewer_phrase
  but psychopharmacology isnâ€™t quite that advanced yet.
