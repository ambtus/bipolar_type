%h2 Suicidal Mania
%p
  BipolarType asserts that suicidal mania happens at the very beginning of a new manic episode which comes on the heels of a severe depressive episode.
%p
  The manic episode does not end naturally because you are still averse to
  =@quad.ep.hit.ing
  and so you never become
  =@quad.ep.sore.punctuate
  You won’t allow yourself to
  =@quad.ip.eat
  =@quad.ip.carbs
  because you still hate yourself for
  =@quad.ip.eat.split.first.ing
  so much when you were depressed.
  But this means you can not sleep. And early mania may be characterized by feeling rested and energetic after a few hours of sleep, but chronic mania is merely characterized by feeling irritable and exhausted because you
  %em can’t
  sleep.
%p
  If you cannot have the “little death”, you may opt for the “eternal sleep”. It doesn’t seem like such a bad idea, since you already hate yourself, and assume everyone else does too. Besides you are sleep deprived and not thinking straight.
%p
  First: stop
  =@quad.ij.eat.ing
  so many
  =@quad.ij.carbs
  — that’s what is keeping you awake. You cannot handle so many
  =@quad.ij.glycogen
  because you are no longer depressed.
%p
  Second:
  =@quad.ip.eat
  as many
  =@quad.ip.carbs
  as you need to: it’s much better to
  =@quad.ip.eat
  too much and be
  =@quad.ip.obese
  than to be dead. And
  %em nobody else
  hates you for
  =@quad.ip.eat.split.first.ing
  as much as you hate yourself so even if other people disapprove, they do
  %em not
  disapprove as much as you
  %em think
  they disapprove, and they do
  %em not
  wish that you were
  %em dead
  instead of
  =@quad.ip.eat.split.first.ing.punctuate
%p
  Third: avoid
  =@quad.ip.carbs
  when you are
  %em not
  tired — for example, first thing in the morning — and save them for bedtime, and to take a nap in the afternoon since you cannot sleep very long at night. You can
  =@quad.ip.eat
  =@quad.ip.protein
  when you are feeling
  =@quad.ip.hungry
  but don’t want to sleep or gain
  =@quad.ip.fat.punctuate
%p
  Fourth:
  =@quad.ip.move
  as much as you can, especially when you wake in the middle of the night.
%p
  Fifth: if you are still
  =@quad.ep.eat.ing
  =@quad.ep.protein
  try to pay close attention to how
  =@quad.ep.sore
  you still feel, as it will help the mania end sooner.
