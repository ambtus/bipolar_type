%p=@quad.subtypes.map(&:evening).to_sentence.capitalize.punctuate
%h3 Depression
%p
  Depression always follows mania.
%p
  If you didnâ€™t
  =@quad.subtypes.map(&:evening).to_sentence
  when you were manic, you will have to
  =@quad.subtypes.map(&:morning).to_sentence
  now that you are depressed.
%h2 Type
=render "subtypes", :subtypes => @quad.subtypes
%h3 Priorities
%p
  Your priorities can and do change over time.
  You always have the same four subtypes, but your circumstances determine how critical it is to
  =@quad.subtypes.map(&:goal).to_sentence(:last_word_connector => ", and/or ").comma
  and your environment determines how difficult it is to do so.
%h3 Strength
%p
  BipolarType is concerned only with energy, and the storage of energy; it says nothing about how strong you are in any realm or in which realms you may need or want to develop more strength.
