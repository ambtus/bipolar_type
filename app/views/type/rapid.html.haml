%p
  Rapid cycling, or kindling, happens over time if your mania is not controlled. Your mania is not controlled when your invisible mania is highly desired and your suicidal “depression” is misdiagnosed as depression and your depression is misdiagnosed as addiction and your invisible depression is highly desired. In other words, when you are extremely unlucky.
%p
  Over time, mania becomes easier and easier to trigger, but it also lasts a shorter time before the inevitable depression.
%p
  I am a rapid cycler, and my cycle lasts about six days on average: three manic days, a crash, three depressed days, and then another manic episode. Manic episodes can be triggered sooner or last longer if I’m under a lot of stress, but six days is typical. Mania is also worse in the spring and fall, and depression is worse in the summer and winter, but the shorter cycle tends to be more of a problem for me.
%p
  The following are my recommendations for dealing with rapid cycling, but I only know that they work for my own subtypes (ISFP-ESTP-ENTJ-INFJ).
