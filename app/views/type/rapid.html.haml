%p
  Rapid cycling, or kindling, happens over time if your mania is not controlled.
%p
  Your mania will not be controlled when everyone is rejoicing so much that you have stopped consuming too many external resources, that they completely miss the fact that you are manic, and when the mania finally ends on its own, as it always does, the rebound depression is treated aggressively instead of being allowed to run its course.
%p
  Over time, mania becomes easier and easier to trigger, but it also lasts a shorter time before the inevitable rebound depression.
%p
  I am a rapid cycler, and my cycle lasts about six days on average: three manic days, a crash, three depressed days, and then another manic episode. Manic episodes can be triggered sooner or last longer if I’m under a lot of stress, but six days is typical. Mania is also worse in the morning, spring and fall, and depression is worse in the evening, summer and winter, but the six-day cycle predominates.
%p
  The following are my recommendations for dealing with rapid cycling, but although they work for me (ISFP-ESTP-ENTJ-INFJ) the recommendations for the other subtypes are based on analogy and may do more harm than good. Caveat emptor.

        Unless they are

        they should try to
        =t(:produce)
        as much as they can, whenever they can. The more they
        =t :produce
        the more
        =t :external_sources
        they will be able to
        =t :consume
        without becoming
        =t :overfull
      %p
        They may find small amounts of short acting
        =t :neurotransmitter
        stimulants helpful but long acting ones can trigger euphoric mania.
        Although they are unlikely to
        =t :run_out
        they will feel
        =t :bad
        when they start
        =t :consuming
        =t :external_sources
        again when they feel
        =t :good
        “enough” but are still taking the meds.
%h2 EP: severe mania & depression

      %p
        Should
        =t(:produce)
        longer whenever they feel
        =t :overfull
        but stop as soon as they feel
        =t :good
        enough; if they
        =t :produce
        too much they will either have to
        =t :consume
        even more
        =t :external_sources
        — and feel
        =t :bad
        — or they will
        =t :run_out
      %p
        =t(:neurotransmitter).capitalize
        stimulants can alleviate the depression but will aggravate the mania.
        =t(:neurotransmitter).capitalize
        sedatives can curtail the mania but will aggravate the depression.

        Should try to

        more
        =t(:external_sources)
        when they are depressed and
        =t(:produce)
        longer when they are manic.

        stimulants can alleviate the depression but will aggravate the mania.
        =t(:neurotransmitter).capitalize
        sedatives can curtail the mania but will aggravate the depression.
%h2 IJ: suicidal “depression” & invisible depression

      %p
        If they can’t be
        =t :an_aversive_consumer
        they should try to
        =t(:consume)
        as many
        =t(:external_sources)
        as they can when they are
        %em actually
        depressed (not when they are actually manic but everyone
        %em thinks
        they are depressed because they are feeling suicidal) and avoid
        =t(:consuming)
        =t(:external_sources)
        as soon as they start to feel
        =t :bad
        before they feel
        =t :worse
      %p
        May find small amounts of long-acting
        =t :neurotransmitter
        sedatives helpful but there are always side-effects and if they get used to being able to
        =t :consume
        =t :external_sources
        and the drug wears off or they become acclimated they will feel so
        =t :bad
        they may take a lethal overdose.
