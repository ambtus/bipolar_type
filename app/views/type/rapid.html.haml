%p
  Rapid cycling, or kindling, happens over time if your mania is not controlled.
%p
  Your mania will not be controlled when everyone is rejoicing so much about your invisible mania, that they completely miss the fact that you are suffering from potentially fatal mania, and when the mania finally ends on its own, as it always does, the rebound depression is treated aggressively instead of being allowed to run its course.
%p
  Over time, mania becomes easier and easier to trigger, but it also lasts a shorter time before your self-preservation instincts kick in and trigger depression before your mania becomes fatal.
%p
  I am a rapid cycler, and my cycle lasts about six days on average: three manic days, a crash, three depressed days, and then another manic episode. Manic episodes can be triggered sooner or last longer if I’m under a lot of stress, but six days is typical. Mania is also worse in the morning, spring and fall, and depression is worse in the evening, summer and winter, but the six-day cycle predominates.
%p
  The following are my recommendations for dealing with rapid cycling, but although they work for me (ISFP-ESTP-ENTJ-INFJ) the recommendations for the other subtypes are based on analogy and may do more harm than good. Caveat emptor.

        Unless they are

        they should try to
        =t(:produce)
        as much as they can, whenever they can. The more they

        the more

        They may find small amounts of short acting meds that
        =t :increase
        =t :neurotransmitter
        helpful, but long acting ones are likely to trigger euphoric mania (see
        ="E#{t(:mbti)}P)."
        Although they are unlikely to
        =t :run_out
        they will feel
        =t :bad
        when they start
        =t :consuming
        =t :external_sources
        again when they feel
        =t :good
        “enough” but are still taking the meds.

        Should

        but stop as soon as they feel

        enough; if they

        too much they will either have to

        even more

        Meds that increase
        =t(:neurotransmitter)
        can alleviate the depression but will aggravate the mania.
        Meds that decrease
        =t(:neurotransmitter)
        can curtail the mania but will aggravate the depression.

        Should try to

        May find small amounts of long-acting meds that
        =t :decrease
        =t :neurotransmitter
        helpful but there are always side-effects or they become acclimated and feel
        =t :bad
        because they have stopped avoiding
