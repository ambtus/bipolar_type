%h4 Footnote:
%p
  The letters
  =Energy.all.to_sentence
  are inherited from the MBTI.
  They are not acronyms for any words used in the BipolarType theory.
%p
  The letters are the symbols I use to identify the four realms, whereas
  =Energy.all.map(&:realm).map(&:capitalize).to_sentence
  are merely the adjectives I am currently using to describe them.
%p
  Future versions of this site may use different words to describe the four realms, but the four symbols will remain the same.

  If you are a linguist, you can think of
  =Energy.all.to_sentence
  as proper names. If you are a programmer, you can think of them as pointer references to a location in my memory.
