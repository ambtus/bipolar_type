%p
  The letters
  =Realm.all.to_sentence
  are inherited from the MBTI.
  They are not acronyms for any words used in the BipolarType theory.

  The letters are the symbols I use to identify the four realms, whereas
  =Realm.all.map(&:name).to_sentence
  are merely the names I am currently using to describe them.
%p
  Future versions of this site may use different words to describe the four realms, but the four symbols will remain the same.

  If you are a linguist, you can think of
  =Realm.all.to_sentence
  as proper names: e.g. “the S-realm”, not “some 
  =Realm.s.domain
  realm”. If you are a programmer, you can think of them as pointer references to essential
  =Realm.n.essentials
  in my brain.
