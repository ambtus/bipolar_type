  Although they like to

  they find it a little easier to avoid

  They find it a little easier to avoid
  %em=@type.tertiary.react("more").punctuate("!")
  signals and the associated

  mania and depression, because they will have to
  =@type.tertiary.act("more").punctuate(",")
  which they donâ€™t always want to do.

  They find it easiest to avoid
  %em=@type.inferior.react("more").punctuate("!")
  signals and the associated
  =@type.inferior.adjective
  mania and depression, because they will have to
  =@type.inferior.act("more").punctuate(",")
