%h2 Mania (Goal Oriented)
%p When you are manic you should make every attempt to #{@type.lazy.achieve_goals} because #{@type.lazy.goals} are the goals you actually want to achieve.
%p You should also try to #{@type.finicky.high_energy_activities}, or at least #{@type.finicky.low_energy_activities}. Not because you want to #{@type.finicky.achieve_goals}, but because the more #{@type.finicky.energy} you use now, the more #{@type.finicky.resources} you will be able to #{@type.finicky.harvest} when you are depressed.
%p
  When you are manic you should make every attempt to
  %em not
  #{@type.hyperactive.high_energy_activities}. Partly because you don’t care that much about #{@type.hyperactive.achieve_goals.ing}, but mostly because the more #{@type.hyperactive.energy} you use now, the more time you will have to waste #{@type.hyperactive.high_energy_harvest.ing} when you are depressed. If you do need to #{@type.hyperactive.achieve_something}, then #{@type.hyperactive.low_energy_activities}.
%p
  You are always going to want to #{@type.greedy.low_energy_activities} when you need to #{@type.greedy.achieve_something}. Whether or not you should #{@type.greedy.high_energy_activities} when you
  %em don’t
  have any#{@type.greedy.thing} you want to #{@type.greedy.achieve} depends on how #{@type.greedy.stored_energy.much} #{@type.greedy.stored_energy} you have and whether or not you are trying to get rid of it.

%h2 Depression (Resource Oriented)
%p When you are depressed you should make every attempt to #{@type.finicky.harvest_resources} because #{@type.finicky.resources} are the resources you actually want to harvest.
%p You should also try to #{@type.lazy.high_energy_harvest}, or at least #{@type.lazy.low_energy_harvest}. Not because you want to #{@type.lazy.harvest_resources}, but because the more #{@type.lazy.energy} you get now, the more #{@type.lazy.goals} you will be able to #{@type.lazy.achieve} when you are manic.

  You are always going to want to #{@type.hyperactive.low_energy_harvest} when you need to #{@type.hyperactive.harvest} something. Whether or not you should #{@type.hyperactive.high_energy_harvest} when you

  have anything you want to #{@type.hyperactive.harvest} depends on how #{@type.hyperactive.stored_energy.much} #{@type.hyperactive.stored_energy} you have and whether or not you are trying to gain more.
