financial
 
basic need: have shelter
 
output: spend
intake: earn
energy: cash
strength: credit
perception: how does it feel? does it trigger dopamine?
judgement: will it be valuable or worthless?
 
other words for the financial realm:
material, commercial, business, measurable, taxable, profitable, economic
 
The financial realm can sometimes seem inverted because most people work for money and work is output: active extroverson. If you getting paid for your physical, mental, or social work, that is still financial <em>intake</em>. Don’t conflate it with financial output (spending money). Financial work would be investing: even if the goal is to get money later, the current behavior during investing is financial output.
