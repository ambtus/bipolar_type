physical output
change places
find it difficult to calm down if they are surrounded by new or problematic places
 
use your body: walk and be aware of the places around you: their weaknesses and their strengths and the way they smell
make trips and influence places
 
physical mania:
good: external focus on interiors and exteriors: homes, gardens, cities, and farms
bad: ignores the needs of their body: can or will not eat or digest
