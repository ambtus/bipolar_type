financial output
change tools (tangible things)
find it difficult to calm down if they are surrounded by new or problematic tools
 
use your wallet: spend and be aware of the tools around you: their weaknesses and their strengths and from way they feel
make purchases and influence things
 
financial mania:
good: external focus on tools and their uses: clothes, shelter, machines, and hardware
bad: ignores the needs of their wallet: can or will not earn or save
