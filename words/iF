social introversion
accept opinions
find it difficult to rev up if they are surrounded by known and trusted people
 
aware of your soul and why you care (oxytocin)
differentiate friends from enemies
 
social depression:
good: internal focus on your soul: its need for fuel (hear, listen, and understand) and rest (shut up and sleep to build language)
bad: ignores the needs of their people: can or will not speak (use their voice)
