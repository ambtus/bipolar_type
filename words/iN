mental introversion
accept facts
find it difficult to rev up if they are surrounded by known and trusted ideas
 
aware of your mind and what it knows (glutamate)
differentiate truth from deception
 
mental depression:
good: internal focus on your mind and its need for fuel (see, watch, learn, and remember) and rest (close your eyes and sleep to build mental models)
bad: ignores the needs of their ideas: can or will not think (use their mind)
