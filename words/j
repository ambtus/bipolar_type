strength
old predator
find it difficult to be responsive or appreciative if they are surrounded by things they anticipate needing to either use strength on or get strength from at any moment
 
good: feel strong and powerful, productive and rewarded, organized and proactive
bad: feel irritable and dissatisfied, controlling and overresponsible,  disappointed but apathetic
 
fall back
fall mixed state: rapid cycle between use and get strength
