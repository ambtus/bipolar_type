digest & flee
 
energetic and free (untethered)
focused (reductionism)
 
reactive young prey
find it difficult to be patient or encompassing; don’t want to be in control or responsible
 
good: feel energetic and playful, appreciative and responsive, agile and enthusiastic, free and happy
bad: feel anxious and trapped, needy and grasping, unhappy and out of control
 
the middle of a fall morning: cycle between digest & flee; very little strength
spring mixed state: cycle between receptive and euphoric
